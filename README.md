Rust raft implementation

Raft is a consensus algorithm for distributed systems, it is inspired by the complexity of Paxos consensus algorithm for managing distributed systems. It was developed to be more straightforward and intuitive than the Paxos consensus algorithm, and it is tailored for addressing non-Byzantine fault tolerance issues.

**Here's something to think about.**? 

> Would you rather spend millions of dollars on distributed computing to achieve high availability, or risk losing billions of dollars? The ironic part is that you can still lose billions of dollars on both fronts if your distributed system is not built correctly. Let's debate.
